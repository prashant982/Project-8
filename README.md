This is the 8th Project that I have made where I have practised some SQL Queries.

1. users.sql - This file contains the schema design for the users.
2. photos.sql - This file contains the schema desing for the photos. 
3. comments.sql - This file contains the schema design for the comments. 
4. likes.sql - This file contains the schema design for the likes.
5. follows.sql - This file contains the schema design for the followers/followees. 
6. tags.sql - This file contains the schema design for the different types of hashtags that a user can attach to the photo that he uploads.
7. photo_tags.sql - This file contains the schema design for the photo that has a particular tag attached to it. 
8. fake_data.sql - It contains the fake date containing all users, photos, comments, likes, follower/followee, tags. 
9. challenges.sql - Some of the basic questions that I have solved using SQL Queries.
